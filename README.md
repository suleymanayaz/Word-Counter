## Tech

- C programing Language


## Installation

This requires [TDM-GCC 4.9.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%204.9%20series/4.9.2-tdm-1%20DW2/) 4.9.2 to run.

If you want to filter the image you want, in the [pgmimage.h](/src/pgmimages.h) file:

```sh
void readFile(char text[]){
  ...
 	if((readd = fopen("text.txt","r")) != NULL){ // text file path 
  ...

} }
```
You should change the text file path in the line.
